# Sequence-to-sequence models for stress testing.

</header>

As the Fed released FRB stress testing scenarios, we tried several deep learning sequence-to-sequence models to forecast one of the series given all others in the scenarios. We used PyTorch library to develop a few models, from a simple LSTM to a more complex attention-based one. We described the modeling steps in the posts below.
